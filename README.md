# conference-bot
this is a bot used for samples and demos. It can be modified and used for conferences if you want.


You'll need to update some values to make it work. Look for "UPDATE_THIS" in the repo and replace the text as needed. This includes 
appid and subscriptionid, etc for Azure Bot Service, LUIS, and QnAMaker
