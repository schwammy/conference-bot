# conference-bot
this is a bot used for samples and demos. It can be modified and used for conferences if you want. 

## The code isn't really done. I don't expect it to work perfectly yet. If you use this code, don't expect perfect results. :)

### To run this code in Visual Studio, you will need to:
* Install Bot Builder SDK v4 (preview). It may be helpful to follow the instructions here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/dotnet/bot-builder-dotnet-quickstart?view=azure-bot-service-3.0&viewFallbackFrom=azure-bot-service-4.0
* Create a LUIS account and application and update the code accordingly.
* Create a QnA Maker account and application and update the code accordingly.

Look for "UPDATE_THIS" in the repo and replace the text as needed. This includes 
appid and subscriptionid, etc for Azure Bot Service, LUIS, and QnAMaker
